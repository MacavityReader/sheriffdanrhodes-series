However, not even Hack and Lawton's friendly word play could have prepared him for the group of writers that have descended upon Blacklin County.\n\nWhen Vernell Lindsey, Clearview's newly published romance novelist, decides to hold a romance writer's convention, residents think this will finally get their town on the map. They are even more excited when they learn that former Clearview resident Terry Don Coslin will headline the event-Terry Don is now the most sought after male cover model for these very novels.\n\nRhodes doesn't understand why so many people are interested in writing, but this becomes the least of his concerns when a local aspiring novelist is found dead in her room at the college. Was her death the work of a jealous rival? Or did her new book get a bit too close to certain people's real lives? As he investigates, Rhodes begins to learn more about the publishing industry and some sordid facts Terry Don. Is he at all connected to the murder? When another murder occurs, Rhodes receives the unwelcome aid of two aspiring novelists, eager to switch from romance to mysteries. Their theories are a little too far from the truth, but Rhodes does make some headway on his own.\n\nRelying on his trademark common sense and cunning and the help of his deputy sheriff Ruth Grady, Rhodes is able to solve the murders although he still can't figure out why so many people want to write a novel.; Clearview, Tex., may seem a far cry from the shire-like coziness of England, but it has its smalltown gossips and eccentrics, even a ghost who for some reason prefers the county jail to a gloomy mansion, in Crider's 11th easy-going Sheriff Dan Rhodes procedural (Too Late to Die; Shotgun Saturday Night; etc.). Rhodes is a likable, low-key lawman, tough as, and when, he has to be. In this case he finds himself investigating two murders at a convention of romance novelists who have arrived in Blackin County. One of the victims is Terry Don Coslin, beefcake male star of many a paperback cover, who grew up in the county. Except for his apparently having slept with almost every woman at the convention, it's unclear why anyone wanted Terry Don dead. The first victim, Henrietta Bayam, is another story. Cattily, she let it be known that she was writing a novel in which she exposed her romance-writing colleagues for all their shortcomings. Before Rhodes is done, he will learn these ladies play rough. He is shot at, clubbed and nearly burned alive. A methodical man, the sheriff credibly solves the crimes. The author has missed a chance by presenting only the surface of the people who inhabit the romance world, though it may be he was being careful not to make anyone too identifiable. Still, there are enough Texas-style oddballs to liven up the tale. Crider fans will welcome this as eagerly as past entries.\n —Publishers Weekly; 9798897489411 9798897489428 9798897489435",

                    "Value": "Dan Rhodes, the sheriff of Blacklin County, Texas, has seen more than his share of strange events during his time in office-most recently he exorcised a ghost from the county jail and he has always tolerated the banter between his elderly jailer and dispatcher. However, not even Hack and Lawton's friendly word play could have prepared him for the group of writers that have descended upon Blacklin County.\n\nWhen Vernell Lindsey, Clearview's newly published romance novelist, decides to hold a romance writer's convention, residents think this will finally get their town on the map. They are even more excited when they learn that former Clearview resident Terry Don Coslin will headline the event-Terry Don is now the most sought after male cover model for these very novels.\n\nRhodes doesn't understand why so many people are interested in writing, but this becomes the least of his concerns when a local aspiring novelist is found dead in her room at the college. Was her death the work of a jealous rival? Or did her new book get a bit too close to certain people's real lives? As he investigates, Rhodes begins to learn more about the publishing industry and some sordid facts Terry Don. Is he at all connected to the murder? When another murder occurs, Rhodes receives the unwelcome aid of two aspiring novelists, eager to switch from romance to mysteries. Their theories are a little too far from the truth, but Rhodes does make some headway on his own.\n\nRelying on his trademark common sense and cunning and the help of his deputy sheriff Ruth Grady, Rhodes is able to solve the murders although he still can't figure out why so many people want to write a novel.",

Rhodes is a likable, low-key lawman, tough as, and when, he has to be. In this case he finds himself investigating two murders at a convention of romance novelists who have arrived in Blackin County. One of the victims is Terry Don Coslin, beefcake male star of many a paperback cover, who grew up in the county. Except for his apparently having slept with almost every woman at the convention, it's unclear why anyone wanted Terry Don dead. The first victim, Henrietta Bayam, is another story. Cattily, she let it be known that she was writing a novel in which she exposed her romance-writing colleagues for all their shortcomings. Before Rhodes is done, he will learn these ladies play rough. He is shot at, clubbed and nearly burned alive. A methodical man, the sheriff credibly solves the crimes. The author has missed a chance by presenting only the surface of the people who inhabit the romance world, though it may be he was being careful not to make anyone too identifiable. Still, there are enough Texas-style oddballs to liven up the tale. Crider fans will welcome this as eagerly as past entries.\n —Publishers Weekly",
