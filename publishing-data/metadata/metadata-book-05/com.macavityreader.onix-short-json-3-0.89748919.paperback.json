The case, which begins as one merely embarrassing (Ah ain't got no TEEF!) quickly turns serious when the owner of the missing dentures, one Lloyd Bobbit, is found suffocated with a plastic grocery bag.\n\nThe prime suspect is a fellow Sunny Daler, Maurice Kennedy, who was known to have had no love for the cantankerous Bobbit—a feud that originated way, way back in the youth of the two men. Now Kennedy is missing—but is he the killer or another victim?\n\nMeanwhile, Rhodes and his two attenuated jailers have been hit with a lawsuit claiming dangerous and inhumane conditions at the local jail. There's not much of a case, considering that the town's best cook provides the prisoners' meals. With all that's going on, Rhodes scarcely has time to pay proper attention to his fortunately ever-patient fiancée, Ivy Daniel.; When a nursing home resident in sheriff Dan Rhodes's small Texas town is found suffocated, a plastic bag tied over his head, the prime suspect, a fellow resident with whom the victim had quarreled, disappears. The victim's daughter, heir to his considerable fortune, harries the sheriff to find the missing man and close the case. Rhodes learns that both old men had been implicated in a possible murder 61 years earlier, but soon another fatality sends Rhodes looking for a more recent motive. Meanwhile, he must cope with a multimillion-dollar lawsuit over conditions at the county jail, preparations for his marriage, the aches of middle age and his fiancee's distress over his hazardous profession. Crider packs his small-town procedural with telling details and clear-eyed observations of human nature.\n—Publishers Weekly; 9798897489169 9798897489176 9798897489183",

The case, which begins as one merely embarrassing (Ah ain't got no TEEF!) quickly turns serious when the owner of the missing dentures, one Lloyd Bobbit, is found suffocated with a plastic grocery bag.\n\nThe prime suspect is a fellow Sunny Daler, Maurice Kennedy, who was known to have had no love for the cantankerous Bobbit—a feud that originated way, way back in the youth of the two men. Now Kennedy is missing—but is he the killer or another victim?\n\nMeanwhile, Rhodes and his two attenuated jailers have been hit with a lawsuit claiming dangerous and inhumane conditions at the local jail. There's not much of a case, considering that the town's best cook provides the prisoners' meals. With all that's going on, Rhodes scarcely has time to pay proper attention to his fortunately ever-patient fiancée, Ivy Daniel.",

The victim's daughter, heir to his considerable fortune, harries the sheriff to find the missing man and close the case. Rhodes learns that both old men had been implicated in a possible murder 61 years earlier, but soon another fatality sends Rhodes looking for a more recent motive. Meanwhile, he must cope with a multimillion-dollar lawsuit over conditions at the county jail, preparations for his marriage, the aches of middle age and his fiancee's distress over his hazardous profession. Crider packs his small-town procedural with telling details and clear-eyed observations of human nature.\n—Publishers Weekly",
