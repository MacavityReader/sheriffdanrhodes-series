Bert has another out in the truck, he tells the sheriff, and 'a couple of legs, too, but they don't match up.'\nA heat wave arrives in Blacklin County along with Los Muertos, a violent motorcycle gang from the city. Then Bert Ramsey is found shot to death. There are questions: Where did the town handyman get the money to buy two color television sets, two VCRs, and a houseful of new furniture? Not to mention six thousand dollars in cash rolled up in a sock in Bert's dresser drawer.\nDan Rhodes doesn't have access to the high-tech detection methods of city police—and probably wouldn't use them if he had. Rhodes has to talk to people and sift the facts from the lies. If he is careful, he believes, and keeps it up, he'll usually get results. 'Keeping it up' involves tangling with Wyneva Greer, Ramsey's former girlfriend now living with a mysterious newcomer to the town, Buster Cullens. Buster becomes the next murder victim—of the same killer? Rhodes isn't sure. He soon tangles with the bikers, sustaining a certain amount of damage in the process.\nMeanwhile, back at the jail, his attenuated employees are bristling about the new deputy, a highly qualified police officer. Plus his personal life has its own problems; does he or does he not want to marry Ivy Daniel?; That easy-going, empathetic, likeable Sheriff Dan Rhodes is up to his neck in a baffling case when a number of arms and legs are found on a trash pile in Blacklin County, Texas. Soon the man who found them is dead and Rhodes wends his way through a gang of rough bikers and assorted Texas types to find a few answers. In this second Rhodes novel (the first was Too Late To Die), Crider mixes just enough human foibles and the right amount of pathos to enhance a fast-moving tale of jealousy and folks gone wrong.\n\n—JV Library Journal;  9798897489053 9798897489060 9798897489077",

Bert has another out in the truck, he tells the sheriff, and "a couple of legs, too, but they don't match up."\nA heat wave arrives in Blacklin County along with Los Muertos, a violent motorcycle gang from the city. Then Bert Ramsey is found shot to death. There are questions: Where did the town handyman get the money to buy two color television sets, two VCRs, and a houseful of new furniture? Not to mention six thousand dollars in cash rolled up in a sock in Bert's dresser drawer.\nDan Rhodes doesn't have access to the high-tech detection methods of city police—and probably wouldn't use them if he had. Rhodes has to talk to people and sift the facts from the lies. If he is careful, he believes, and keeps it up, he'll usually get results. "Keeping it up" involves tangling with Wyneva Greer, Ramsey's former girlfriend now living with a mysterious newcomer to the town, Buster Cullens. Buster becomes the next murder victim—of the same killer? Rhodes isn't sure. He soon tangles with the bikers, sustaining a certain amount of damage in the process.\nMeanwhile, back at the jail, his attenuated employees are bristling about the new deputy, a highly qualified police officer. Plus his personal life has its own problems; does he or does he not want to marry Ivy Daniel?",

Soon the man who found them is dead and Rhodes wends his way through a gang of rough bikers and assorted Texas types to find a few answers. In this second Rhodes novel (the first was Too Late To Die), Crider mixes just enough human foibles and the right amount of pathos to enhance a fast-moving tale of jealousy and folks gone wrong.\n\n—JV Library Journal",
