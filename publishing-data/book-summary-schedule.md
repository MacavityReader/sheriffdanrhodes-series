| 1     | Too Late To Die                 | Chapter 1: 05:42 -- 09:43<br>(4m, 1s)	| *Everyone knew her. A lot of them liked her. One of them killed her.*     	| Jeanne Clinton was a pretty and well-liked woman—though in her younger days she'd been known to be a bit wild. She married an older man and settled down to a quiet, respectable life. Now she’s dead, brutally murdered in her home.<br><br>Dan Rhodes, the thoughtful, hard-working sheriff of Blacklin County, Texas, has enough to worry about already: a rash of burglaries in town and an election coming up against a hotshot opponent. Now he's got to find a killer among the residents of his little town—a wily killer, bound and determined not to be caught.<br><br>The deeper Rhodes digs into the hearts and minds of his neighbors, the more secrets he turns up, and the more violence he encounters. But Rhodes doesn't give up easily. And neither does the killer. | 
| 2     | Shotgun Saturday Night          | Chapter 3: 00:00 -- 06:13<br>(6m, 13s)	| *A violent motorcycle gang turns up in Blacklin County.*     					| Sheriff Dan Rhodes knows it's going to be a bad day when Bert Ramsey arrives at the jail with a neatly wrapped arm and lays it on Dan's desk.<br><br>Then Bert Ramsey is shot to death, and serious crime takes over. A tattoo on the body discloses that Ramsey was once a member of Los Muertos, a violent motorcycle gang from the city, and current members of the gang turn up in Blacklin County.<br><br>Rhodes doesn't have access to the high-tech detection methods of city police—and probably wouldn't use them if he had. Rhodes has to talk to people and sift the facts from the lies. If he is careful, he believes, and keeps it up, he'll usually get results.<br><br>Meanwhile, back at the jail, his employees are bristling about the new deputy, a highly qualified police officer. Plus his personal life has its own problems; does he or does he not want to marry Ivy Daniel? |
| 3     | Cursed To Death               | Chapter 1: 00:00 -- 00:00<br>(0m, 0s)	| *A dentist goes missing after being cursed by a witch.*     	| In tiny Blacklin County, Texas, a curse is nothing more than a four-letter word hollered in a barroom or muttered in the heat. So Sheriff Dan Rhodes is more curious than concerned when he dutifully responds to a complaint of witchcraft.<br><br>When Dr. Samuel Martin, the local dentist — and unpopular landlord — claims he's been hexed by a tenant, Rhodes does his best to smooth things out between the distressed D.D.S. and the would-be witch. But in two shakes of a black cat's tail, the good doctor disappears... and his wife turns up bludgeoned to death.<br><br>For Rhodes, it means there's a bad moon rising over Blacklin County. And now he's got to do the voodoo he does best — asking pointed questions and extracting the painful truth from some tight-lipped suspects who also bite... | 
| 4     | Cursed To Death               | Chapter 1: 00:00 -- 00:00<br>(0m, 0s)	| *Someone in Blacklin County is being disrespectful of the dead.*     	| Someone in Blacklin County is being disrespectful of the dead, and Sheriff Dan Rhodes must put a stop to it.<br><br>First, there's the matter of the bodies at Ballinger's Funeral Home and the apparent misplacing of their valuables; the bereaved are beside themselves. There'd best be immediate action or the bell could toll again, this time for Sheriff Dan's reputation as the guardian of justice and decency in these parts.<br><br>As if that weren't enough to contend with, yet another body tumbles into Sheriff Dan's path—out of a closet this time, and trussed up in most unsavory fashion. More disrespect, but obviously a separate case from the funeral home. Or is it?<br><br>Meanwhile, with Hack Jensen and his sidekick Lawton (more comic than cop team) minding the jail, thank heavens there's Deputy Ruth Grady for backup. On the personal front, his fiancée, Ivy Daniel, is supportive as always, but a mystery rears its perplexing head here as well—namely, will Sheriff Dan propose or will he not?<br><br>Tough questions on every side, and guess who's expected to come up with the answers before he gets carried away by Death On the Move?|
| 5     | Evil At The Root             | Chapter 1: 00:00 -- 00:00<br>(0m, 0s)	| *A nursing home resident is found suffocated, and a fellow resident disappears*     	| In this latest Sheriff Dan Rhodes adventure, Bill Crider sends the small-town lawman to investigate the apparent theft of a set of false teeth from one of the elderly residents of the Sunny Dale Nursing Home. The case, which begins as one merely embarrassing ("Ah ain't got no TEEF!") quickly turns serious when the owner of the missing dentures, one Lloyd Bobbit, is found suffocated with a plastic grocery bag.<br><br>The prime suspect is a fellow Sunny Daler, Maurice Kennedy, who was known to have had no love for the cantankerous Bobbit—a feud that originated way, way back in the youth of the two men. Now Kennedy is missing—but is he the killer or another victim?<br><br>Meanwhile, Rhodes and his two attenuated jailers have been hit with a lawsuit claiming dangerous and inhumane conditions at the local jail. There's not much of a case, considering that the town's best cook provides the prisoners' meals. With all that's going on, Rhodes scarcely has time to pay proper attention to his fortunately ever-patient fiancée, Ivy Daniel.|
| 6     | Booked For A Hanging            | Chapter 1: 00:00 -- 00:00<br>(0m, 0s)	| *A presumed suicide begins to look more and more like murder.*     	| The versatile mystery novelist Bill Crider has created a pantheon of marvelous characters, but none is more real, warm, and thoroughly delightful than Sheriff Dan Rhodes of Blacklin County, Texas.<br><br>In his sixth adventure, Rhodes is confronted with what seems at first to be a suicide: the body of a man newly arrived in the county is found hanged in the dilapidated building he has taken over for his business. Simon Graham was a rare-book dealer. If it seems unlikely to find such an arcane entrepreneur in this extremely rural and sparsely populated part of Texas, it becomes less strange when it turns out that Graham was more con man than bibliophile. The presumed suicide begins to look more and more like murder when several newcomers swoop down on the scene and try to beat out one another to find a reputedly valuable rare book that Graham was rumored to have among his collection of hardly worthwhile items.<br><br>Although Rhodes's two attenuated and eccentric jailhouse employees have gone overboard for the magic of the department's new computer, the steady, if put-upon, Rhodes and his clear-eyed observations of human nature have invariably been more useful to the solution of a crime - and that is still true in the case of the hanged book dealer.|
| 7     | Murder Most Fowl          | Chapter 1: 00:00 -- 00:00<br>(0m, 0s)	| *Would-be emu ranchers with little respect for the law, disrupt life in Blacklin Co.*     	| Following Booked for a Hanging, Anthony Award-winner Bill Crider brings back his amiable, computer-phobic sheriff Dan Rhodes to investigate a murder that may or may not be related to a recent wave of emu-rustling. For an officer of the law, Blacklin County, Texas, used to be pretty peaceful, but now, what with the emu-rustling, cockfights, and protests at the new Wal-Mart store — not to mention murder — Sheriff Dan Rhodes has his hands full.<br><br>Hit hard by the collapse of his little hardware store, Elijah ("Lige") Ward has taken to chaining himself to the Wal-Mart doors and generally making a nuisance of himself. And when Lige's dead body turns up, floating down a river in a portable toilet, Rhodes finds he has quite a case to investigate. What was the connection between Lige and chickens? Lige and the Palm Club? And was he involved in the area's emu thefts? It seems that raising emus ("taste like steak, not chicken") is a booming business, so much so that emu ("calmer than ostriches and more resistant to disease") are being stolen left, right, and center by would-be emu ranchers with little respect for the law.<br><br>From theft to murder, the local crime spree seems unstoppable. But with a little help from the computer foisted on him by aging deputies Hack and Lawton, plus some good old-fashioned detective work, Rhodes just may be able to straighten out his county.|
| 8     | Winning Can Be Murder         | Chapter 1: 00:00 -- 00:00<br>(0m, 0s)	| *A football coach is found shot to death in his car, leading to troublesome rumors of illegal betting.*     	| It's been a while since Sheriff Dan Rhodes's football days, but things haven't really changed, at least not with state playoffs coming up and excitement for the local high school team heating up to a fever pitch.<br><br>But then coach Brady Meredith is found shot to death in his car, and his murder leads to troublesome rumors concerning illegal betting, black market steroids and the sheriff's old nemesis, a biker named Rapper, who has reappeared in Blacklin County. Too many coincidences for Rhodes's comfort. Especially when another corpse makes it a second down for a killer determined to lead Sheriff Rhodes into a game of sudden death.|
| 9     | Death By Accident        | Chapter 1: 00:00 -- 00:00<br>(0m, 0s)	| *Two strange deaths in two weeks*     	| Sheriff Dan Rhodes' cases usually concern the bad boys of rural Blacklin County, or the slightly wacky citizens who are causing trouble that tends to be funny rather than criminal. But although at first the dead man floating in the old swimming pool at the edge of town seems to have been an accident victim — a staggering drunk tumbling into the water — Rhodes and his small but colorful staff soon uncover murder.<br><br>It's the second strange death in two weeks (the other was that of John West, killed when he blew up carrying a gasoline can across a field). But where was the Cherokee wagon John was carrying the gas to? And why is his widow so jaunty? West was a solid citizen; Pep Yeldell, the swimming pool decedent, was a man with many enemies.<br><br>In his quiet way, Rhodes goes about looking for a connection and a killer — a quest that takes Rhodes, no athlete now in spite of his wife's efforts to keep him on a diet of little meat and lots of greens, up a tree and puts him at the mercy of a vicious killer.|
| 10     | A Ghost Of A Chance      | Chapter 1: 00:00 -- 00:00<br>(0m, 0s)	| *Hack and Lawton discover a jailhouse ghost.*     	| In this tenth installment of the Sheriff Dan Rhodes series, the Blacklin County law enforcer is back to solve even more mysteries. Some of the most amusing sequences in Crider's Blacklin county mysteries are set in the jailhouse, and star the ongoing word battles between its two septuagenarian denizens, Hack the dispatcher and Lawton, the jailer.<br><br>This time no one at the jailhouse is laughing and Rhodes has a new problem. Not only is the jailhouse itself rumored to be haunted, but a mysterious corpse is found in an open grave in the neighboring town. Rhodes uses his laid back sleuthing skills to find the answers to these puzzling events, which Crider depicts with his usual humor, suspense and small town ambiance.|
| 11     | A Romantic Way To Die          | Chapter 3: 00:03 -- 05:28<br>(5m, 28s)	| *A group of romance writers descends upon Blacklin County*     					| When Vernell Lindsey, Clearview’s newly published romance novelist, decides to hold a romance writer's convention, residents think this will finally get their town on the map. They are even more excited when they learn that former Clearview resident Terry Don Coslin will headline the event-Terry Don is now the most sought after male cover model for these very novels.<br><br>Rhodes doesn't understand why so many people are interested in writing, but this becomes the least of his concerns when a local aspiring novelist is found dead in her room at the college. Was her death the work of a jealous rival? Or did her new book get a bit too close to certain people’s real lives?<br><br>As he investigates, Rhodes begins to learn more about the publishing industry and some sordid facts Terry Don. Is he at all connected to the murder? When Terry Don wanders off the campus, the shooting starts and Rhodes finds himself staring down the wrong end of a shotgun.<br><br>When another murder occurs, Rhodes receives the unwelcome aid of two aspiring novelists, eager to switch from romance to mysteries. Their theories are a little too far from the truth, but Rhodes does make some headway on his own.<br><br>Relying on his trademark common sense and cunning and the help of his deputy sheriff Ruth Grady, Rhodes is able to solve the murders although he still can’t figure out why so many people want to write a novel. | 
| 12     | Red, White, And Blue Murder     | Chapter 1: 00:00 -- 00:00<br>(0m, 0s)	| *A man dies in a fire that involves fireworks while someone is spreading lies.*     	| Sheriff Dan Rhodes has half a mind to shoot the next person who asks if it's hot enough for him, what with the near hundred-degree heat and a months-old drought. He's also a bit warm under the collar over an ambitious local reporter's allegations of corruption in the local county commissioner's office - accusations that include him as well.<br><br>Rhodes has no trouble clearing his own name, but manages to uncover some nasty business over at the commissioner's office. But when the charred body of the county commissioner is found among the ashes of his torched fishing cabin, Rhodes suspects July's fireworks are only getting started. Toss in some small scheming, bribery and dirty romance, and it only goes to prove the seasoned lawman's tried and tested theory about murder: it always boils down to love or money. Sometimes both.|
| 13     | A Mammoth Murder     | Chapter 1: 00:00 -- 00:00<br>(0m, 0s)	| *A body found in the forest raises suspicions about Bigfoot lurking there.*     	| One hot summer morning, big, tough Bud Turley brings an enormous tooth into the Blacklin County police station and asks Sheriff Dan Rhodes to keep it for him until the paleontologist from the community college comes up to examine it. Turley insists that the tooth is proof that Bigfoot roams the woods---unless it is from a prehistoric animal, which Rhodes thinks is more likely. But Turley's buddy Larry Colley has maintained for years that he's seen Bigfoot. Most inhabitants of Blacklin County have avoided those woods, but Colley and Bud are at home there, and Turley is ready to crow over his find. However, the next day his body is found in the forest, leaving Larry Colley more certain than ever that a monster is lurking there.<br><br>Dan Rhodes is not sure that Bud's death is the work of an "ordinary" criminal. And he wouldn't be too surprised if somehow feral hogs were involved; Rhodes knows what many Texans don't---it is estimated that at least a million and a half feral hogs roam the state; many believe it could be twice that many. But when the sheriff is faced with the murder of an elderly woman in the small store she ran at the edge of the woods, he knows he has a human killer on his hands.<br><br>A Mammoth Murder is Bill Crider's thirteenth mystery featuring Sheriff Dan Rhodes, his two-man headquarters "staff," and the quirky citizens of Blacklin County.

His wife, Ivy, recognized the cat as belonging to their neighbor and told Dan to go check on the widow--Helen Harris never let the cat out of the house.<br><br>When Dan finds Helen's body on her kitchen floor, there is nothing to indicate that her death wasn't an accident. But Ivy's words ring in his head. Why was the cat out?<br><br>Helen had been active in a number of women's groups, one of which was the OWLS, the Older Women's Literary Society. She and some other women would also venture out with digging tools to look for ancient booty in the lands around the town. They didn't usually find much, but every now and then someone would dig up a coin or a piece of jewelry with potential.

Also, a news-hungry reporter who smells a juicy story gives Rhodes more trouble.<br><br>This is the fourteenth book in which Bill Crider has wowed readers with the extraordinary adventures of his Sheriff Dan Rhodes.

However, when a mobile home explodes and a dead body is found, the students become the chief suspects, and the commissioners aren’t happy. To make matters worse, there’s another murder, and one of Rhodes’s old antagonists returns with his partner in crime to cause even more trouble.<br><br>As always in Blacklin County, there are plenty of minor annoyances to go along with the major ones. For one thing, there’s a problem with the county’s Web page. The commissioners blame Rhodes, who knows nothing about the Internet but is supposed to be overseeing their online presence. Then there’s the illegal alcohol being sold in a local restaurant. It was produced in a still that Rhodes discovered after the explosion of the mobile home, and he’s sure it has some connection to the murders.<br><br>It’s another fun ride with genre veteran Bill Crider, and, once again, it’s up to Sheriff Dan Rhodes to save the day before Blacklin County becomes the crime capital of Texas.|

He's momentarily distracted by a rogue alligator on the loose, but shortly afterward, Lloyd Berry, the director of the chorus, is murdered. Berry is suspected of embezzling money, and he's leaked the information that a member of the chorus ordered a singing valentine for a woman who isn't his wife. Later, Rhodes discovers that Berry has been gambling on eight-liners at Rollin' Sevens, a barely legal operation in a strip center on the outskirts of town.<br><br>Rhodes also must deal with the usual assortment of small-town crimes: a man dressed in his underpants and cowboy boots picketing a law office, dogfood theft, and attempts on the life of a man who likes to root through garbage.

The smell is coming from the giant chicken farm owned by Lester Hamilton. Rhodes sees this as a matter for the state’s air-quality enforcement agency, not the county sheriff. That all changes, however, when Hamilton is found dead, floating in an old rock pit not far from the town of Clearview. Hamilton had probably been engaged in the act of noodling for catfish, which is not only highly dangerous but illegal in Texas.<br><br>Rhodes suspects that Hamilton didn’t die by accident, though. There are plenty of suspects, including an eccentric community college professor and one of his colleagues, who lives near the chicken farm and has to wear a respirator mask to ward off the smell.

Someone's threatened them by slaughtering one of their animals and leaving it on their doorstep. Then Sheriff Dan Rhodes and Deputy Ruth Grady stumble across a dead man while searching the woods for a convenience store robber.<br><br>The investigation into the man's death is complicated by angry hog hunters, a crusading talk-show host, a bounty hunter named Hoss, conflicts with the county commissioners, and the reappearance of Rapper and Nellie, the inept two-man motorcycle gang that's caused Rhodes considerable trouble in the past. By the time he's sorted through all the clues, Rhodes discovers that quite a few people aren't who they seemed to be, including those he's known for a long time.

There was a lot of gossip going on about Lynn before her death, but no one seems to really know much about her, or they're not telling Rhodes.<br><br>Lynn was known to flirt, and it's possible an angry wife or jilted lover had something to do with her death.

Wellington was clearly involved in a struggle with someone and has died as a result. Sheriff Dan Rhodes pursues and arrests Ike Terrell, a student who was fleeing the campus. Ike's father is Able Terrell, a survivalist who has withdrawn from society and lives in a gated compound. He's not happy that his son has chosen to attend the college, and he's even less happy with the arrest.<br><br>Rhodes discovers that Wellington and Ike had had a confrontation over a paper that Wellington insisted Ike plagiarized.

The grateful victim gives his name as Cal Stinson, on his way to the nearby town of Thurston to take a look at the old school building before the city tears it down.<br><br>The next day, Cal Stinson turns up again. Only this time, he's dead.<br><br>His body is found in the dilapidated school that's about to be razed, and the woman who let Cal onto the premises claims he gave his name as Bruce Wayne. Whoever is he is, he was shot in the back of the head, and a piece of chalk lies inches away from his hand, under a lone line on the chalkboard, his last words unfinished.<br><br>Between not-so-bright hoodlums who can't seem to stay on the right side of the law, powerful families in town who are ready to go to battle over whether the old school should come down, and trying futilely to get private detective Seepy Benton to stop making mountains of mole hills, Sheriff Rhodes is beginning to wonder if retirement might be as good as it sounds.|
