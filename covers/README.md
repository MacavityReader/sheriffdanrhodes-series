 # Digital First Book Design

The Sheriff Dan Rhodes series was refreshed in 2025 using a "digital first" book design. This design concept is focused on making the books deeply integrated into the digital reader applications across major digital platforms. These platforms include: Apple, Kindle, Kobo, Nook, and Android. Embracing a mobile, digital first design not only improves the digital reading experience but also engages the readers in ways that encourage them to collect and read the entire 25-book series.
